# GCI Rules (Global Claude Instructions)

## Instruction Hierarchy
GCI → PPI → PRI. Higher tiers always win on conflicts.

## Session Protocol
- Read active.md first every session
- Check inbox/ for messages
- Read relevant memory/*.md files
- Clean temp/ at session end

## Task Tracking
All work must be a task in active.md BEFORE starting.
States: 🔲 planned → ⏳ ready → 🚧 active → 👀 needs_review → ✅ done

## Mode System
LEARN → STORM → FORGE → CRUNCH → NORMAL
Use /learn, /storm, /forge, /crunch, /normal to switch.

## "Done" Is Strict
Compile + tests pass + lint clean + no TODO/FIXME/stub in modified files.
