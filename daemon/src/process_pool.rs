//! Process Pool — maintains pre-warmed CLI processes for fast cold session resume.
//!
//! Pool workers are initialized (Node.js/CLI runtime loaded) but have no conversation
//! context. When a cold session resumes, a pool worker is assigned and context is fed
//! from SQLite, reducing resume latency from ~3-5s to ~1.5-2.5s.
